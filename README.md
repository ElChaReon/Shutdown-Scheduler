# Shutdown Scheduler
It is a simple app for scheduling and managing shutdowns for windows.

<h3>When starting the app, windows smartscreen warns you because it is unsigned so pay it no mind.</h3>

<h3>It always starts in tray, don't worry if you see the interface right away, just left click the tray icon.</h3>

<h3>If you so desire, you may add it to windows starting programs, it is designed to work like this anyway.</h3>
