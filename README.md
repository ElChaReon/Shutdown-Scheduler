# Shutdown Scheduler
It is a simple app for scheduling and managing shutdowns for windows.</h3>
<hr>
When starting the app, windows smartscreen warns you because it is unsigned so pay it no mind.<br>
It always starts in tray, don't worry if you see the interface right away, just <b>left-click</b> the tray icon.<br>
If you so desire, you may add it to windows starting programs, it is designed to work like this anyway.
